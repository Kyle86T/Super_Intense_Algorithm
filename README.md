# Super_Intense_Algorithm
This is my algorithm to trade option using machine learning

This macro is designed to run script on an excel  sheet containing stock data. The columns should be in the following order:
Stock Name (Ticker)
Date
Open Value
High Value
Low Value
Close Value
Volume

The macro will take the data and create the following new columns:
Ticker (column I)
Yearly Change (column J)
Yearly Percent Change (column K)
Total Stock Volume (column L)

It will then take the beginning and ending values for each individual ticker and show Yearly Change, Percent Change
and Total Stock Volumes in these new columns.
